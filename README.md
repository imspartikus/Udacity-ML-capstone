# Udacity machine learning capstone project

This project contains the notebook and data files for the capstone project I completed for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree.  The project was to take data from a Starbucks data set and produce a predicitive machine learning algorithm.  Starbucks has lots of customer data from its mobile app.  Periodically they send out marketing offers including buy one get one offers to thier mobile users.  They want to know how likely it is that a user will complete the offer based on user past performance and demographics.

The provided transcript.json file is too large for the github repo but can be found on the udacity site for the Starbucks capstone course.
